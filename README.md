# Python - Learn by Building Projects


#### 1] What is Programming?
- Giving instruction to a computer and the instruction which computer do understand(i.e. <b>the most important</b>).
- `Coding` is all about having the process, breaking down the stes and thinking more.
- Writing code is the easy part -> Thinking about it - `having the thought process of a programmer.` i.e. the toughest part of it.

<br>

#### 2] Convert that into Python Code

- [x] **Fuction** menas => just Wrap instruction in a box

<br>


#### 3] A Real World Python COde Intro

- [x]  `Object`
- In the world of programming lot of things are called as **Object**
	- E.g. cup, kettle, chai

- [x] `Properties`
	- E.g. cup color, chai sweetness

- [x] `Methods/Functions`
	- E.g. actions -> stir, pour, drink

- Open up a factory, there is method knows as => `__init__`
- class init ==> means class initialize

<br>


#### 4] Why do want to learn Python?
- [x] Portable 
	- Once being written it can be used on anywhere at all. 
- [x] Readable i.e. kind of predictable
- [x] Productive
- [x] Standard library
- [x] Multi-use

<br>


#### 5] Writing first Python code
- [x] In shell running problem is `no memory` or there is no store way of keeping the files.
- [x] Test python
```bash
python testpython.py
3.13.5 (tags/v3.13.5:6cb20a2, Jun 11 2025, 16:15:46) [MSC v.1943 64 bit (AMD64)]
```

<br>


#### 6] Get everything in Virtual Environment
- [x] Story behind Virtual Environment
	- Its like **safeguarding your application from other versions & don't clutter your operating system.
	- Program actually moves safely in other environment as well on Linux, on Mac or other computer.
	- For every application create standalone Python Environment.
